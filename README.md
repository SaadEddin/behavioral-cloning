### Overview

This is the third project in the [SDC Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013 "SDC Engineer Nanodegree")  from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/ "Udacity"), where we train a deep learning model using RGB images generated by 3 cameras installed on the front hood cover of the car, with the objective of predicting the steering angle. Driving a car is more complex than only how to steer the car: ideally, we would like the model to also deal with throttle, breaking and control speeds at specific segments of the road, but for the purpose of this project, we're only trying to model for the steering angle.

This README is structured as follows: 

* [Data: Sources, Exploration and Enrichment](#section_0).
* [Generator Functions](#section_1) for the training and validation data.
* [Model Architecture](#section_2) Description of the layers, overfitting methods, etc.
* [Model Training](#section_3)
* [Discussion](#section_4)
* [Results](#section_5)

The model parameters file and a video of a full round in each track are provided.


### [Data: Sources, Exploration and Enrichment](#section_0)

Two sources of data are used for training the model in this project. The first source is Udacity's own data. Each data point provides 3 images from three cameras at the front hood cover of the car (left, center and right), along with speed, throttle, break and steering angle.

This dataset is imbalanced since the majority of datapoints are within a small range from straight driving (within the range of -0.15 to 0.15). See figure \ref{udacity_data_hist} for the histogram of steering angle values.Training the model using this source provided very unreliable results in the simulator.
